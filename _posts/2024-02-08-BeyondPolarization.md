Experience the Bible as a meeting point – beyond the polarizations of our days. Get a new, fresh, challenging and relevant perspective on seemingly familiar texts!
<br>
What sounds like a bold promise, or the advertisement for a “new magical method” is non less then the experience we made over the last years.

“We” is a group of Jews and Christians from Germany and Israel. We do one thing – and one thing only: We read biblical texts and join into a conversation with them. We bring our differing ages, professional and private backgrounds, political views and religious traditions to the table and try to leave them behind at the same time. Confused, sceptical, intrigued? Come join us for one evening of Dialogical Bible Reading
